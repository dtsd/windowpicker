=About=
Yet another alt+tab replacement. 
Before I've started writing this app I've used TaskSwitchXP for windows. It's great app for switching windows. But only when window count below 10. When you have more windows you notice that:
 * picking windows with keybord shortucts is only for windows 1 through 10
 * even when height maxed only 20 window captions shown, so you have to scroll
 * preview can be seen only when hovering caption with mouse

So my aim was to create alt+tab replacement that match these requirements:
 * all windows previews and captions are shown at once
 * you can call it and pick windows with keyboard only (with minimum keystrokes, a-la vimperator for FF)
 * you can call it and pick windows with mouse only

=Features=
 * Pick window with single click: move mouse to the edge of the screen to see window list and click on preview to choose window
 * Pick window with minimum keypresses: press Ctrl+Alt+E to see window list and press, say, C for third window
 * All window previews and captions displayed at once
 * Replace default alt+tab window switcher

=Translations=
 * English
 * Russian
